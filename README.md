# FlappyBird

Welcome to Flappy Bird Java! I created this project to enhance my understanding of game development concepts such as game physics, collision detection, and the overall game development process. Flappy Bird Java is a simple yet challenging game where players control a bird and navigate it through obstacles by tapping the screen or pressing a key. Flappy Bird provides a hands-on opportunity to explore the fascinating world of game development.
